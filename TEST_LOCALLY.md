# Test Demo Locally - Quick Start

Before deploying to Railway, test everything works on your local machine.

**Time: 10 minutes**

---

## Step 1: Install Python Packages

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
cd C:\Users\vikra\Git\ff-planning

pip install streamlit pandas plotly openpyxl
```

**Expected output:**
```
Successfully installed streamlit-X.X.X pandas-X.X.X plotly-X.X.X openpyxl-X.X.X
```

**If you get an error:**
- Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed: `python --version`
- Try: `python -m pip install streamlit pandas plotly openpyxl`

---

## Step 2: Verify Streamlit Works

```bash
streamlit hello
```

**Expected:**
- Browser opens automatically
- Shows Streamlit "Welcome" demo with animations
- If working, press Ctrl+C to stop

**If browser doesn't open:**
- Manually go to: http://localhost:8501

---

## Step 3: Run Your Demo

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

**Expected:**
- Browser opens to http://localhost:8501
- Shows TEM IPA Manager Dashboard
- Demo banner at top (orange warning box)
- Fleet Overview page loads with 8 vessels

---

## Step 4: Test Each Feature

### ‚úÖ Fleet Overview Page

**What to check:**
- Table shows 8 vessels
- Status column has emojis (‚úÖ ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ùå)
- Northern Star shows "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING"
- Sea Wolf shows "‚ùå VIOLATION"
- Arctic King shows "‚ùå VIOLATION"
- Bottom metrics show: 3-4 compliant, 1-2 warnings, 2-3 violations

**If something's wrong:**
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify `src/demo_data.py` exists

---

### ‚úÖ Vessel Details Page (THE KILLER FEATURE)

**What to check:**

1. Click "Vessel Details" in sidebar

2. Select "Northern Star" from dropdown

3. Verify you see:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING status badge (orange/yellow)
   - Current 4-Trip Average: ~290,000 lbs
   - Last 4 trips table
   - **Next Trip Calculator** section ‚≠ê
   - Projection table with 4 scenarios
   - Custom calculator with input box
   - Chart showing all trips with trend line

4. Test custom calculator:
   - Enter "250000" in the input
   - Click "Calculate"
   - Should show green ‚úÖ message: "New average would be 281,250 lbs - COMPLIANT"

5. Try "Northern Star" then switch to "Sea Wolf":
   - Should show ‚ùå VIOLATION (red)
   - Should show current average >300k

**This is your demo centerpiece - make sure it works perfectly!**

---

### ‚úÖ Violation Reports Page

**What to check:**

1. Click "Violation Reports" in sidebar

2. Verify three sections:
   - **Trip Limit Violations:** Shows Sea Wolf (and maybe Ocean Voyager)
   - **Egregious Violations:** Shows Arctic King with 340,000 lbs trip
   - **MRA Violations:** Shows Golden Catch with Pacific Cod overage

3. Check "Export All Violations to CSV" button exists (won't download in demo)

---

### ‚úÖ Upload Data Page

**What to check:**

1. Click "Upload Data" in sidebar

2. See file uploader widget

3. Click "Expected File Format" expander:
   - Shows table with example data format
   - Has vessel_id, delivery_date, pollock_lbs columns

4. **Optional:** Create a test CSV to upload:
   - Create `test_upload.csv` with:
   ```csv
   vessel_id,delivery_date,pollock_lbs,season,fishing_year
   AK-9999,2026-03-01,280000,A,2026
   AK-9999,2026-03-04,290000,A,2026
   ```
   - Upload it
   - Should show "File uploaded successfully: 2 rows"
   - Should show data preview table
   - Should show green validation checkmarks

---

## Step 5: Visual Check

**Theme and Branding:**
- Primary color is blue (#0066CC)
- Clean, professional appearance
- Footer shows "fishermenfirst.org"
- Demo banner at top is orange
- Status colors work: Green ‚úÖ, Yellow/Orange ‚ö†Ô∏è, Red ‚ùå

**Charts:**
- Trip history chart has two dashed lines (300k and 335k limits)
- Points are connected with lines
- Current 4-trip window highlighted with red circles
- Hover shows trip details

---

## Step 6: Performance Check

**Test responsiveness:**
1. Switch between vessels quickly (dropdown)
2. Navigate between pages (sidebar)
3. Should feel fast (<1 second)

**If slow:**
- Normal for first load (Streamlit compiles)
- Subsequent actions should be fast
- This is test data - no database delays

---

## Common Issues

### Import Error: "No module named 'demo_data'"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd C:\Users\vikra\Git\ff-planning

# Check structure
dir src
# Should show: app.py, demo_data.py

# Run from project root
streamlit run src/app.py
```

### Port Already in Use

**Fix:**
```bash
# Stop existing Streamlit process
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal

# Or specify different port
streamlit run src/app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Blank Page or Errors

**Fix:**
1. Check terminal for error messages
2. Common issues:
   - Missing dependency: `pip install [package]`
   - Python version too old: Need 3.8+
   - File path issues: Run from project root

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Demo loads without errors
‚úÖ All 8 vessels appear in Fleet Overview
‚úÖ Northern Star shows WARNING status
‚úÖ Next Trip Calculator works (custom input)
‚úÖ Charts display with proper formatting
‚úÖ Upload page shows file uploader
‚úÖ Theme colors are correct (blue primary)

---

## Ready to Deploy?

If all tests pass, you're ready for Railway deployment!

**Next:** See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## Demo Tips

**For interview committee:**

1. **Start with Northern Star** (the warning vessel)
   - Shows proactive support
   - Use Next Trip Calculator
   - Say: "IPA Manager can call them right now and say 'Keep your next trip under 275k'"

2. **Show Arctic King** (egregious)
   - Point to chart spike
   - Shows you understand all the rules

3. **Mention production features**
   - "This is test data - production will connect to real eLandings"
   - "We'll add authentication so only IPA Manager can access"
   - "Database will persist all historical data"

4. **Keep it short**
   - 5-minute demo is perfect
   - Don't show every vessel
   - Focus on the value: proactive support vs. just reporting

Good luck! üêü
